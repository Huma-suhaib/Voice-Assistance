# Sofia - AI Voice Assistant

Welcome to **Sofia**, an AI-powered voice assistant developed in Python. This project enables hands-free web interaction and task automation through voice commands. It's designed to be your personal assistant, capable of performing various tasks such as opening websites, playing music, fetching news headlines, and more.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Utilizes speech recognition to accurately interpret user commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Provides audio feedback through the `pyttsx3` library, making interactions natural and efficient.
- **Web Automation**: Capable of opening websites, playing songs, and retrieving news headlines using simple voice commands.
- **Custom Commands**: Easily extendable to include additional custom commands and functionalities.
- **Error Handling**: Integrated error handling to ensure smooth and reliable operation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Huma-suhaib/Voice-Assistance.git
   cd Voice-Assistance
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Assistant**:
   Start the voice assistant with:
   ```bash
   python Sofia.py
   ```

## How It Works

Sofia listens for voice commands through your microphone, processes the audio input using the `speech_recognition` library, and responds with the appropriate action. It uses `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech output, making the interaction conversational. The commands are processed in real-time, allowing for an efficient and responsive user experience.

## Customization

You can easily add or modify commands by editing the `commands.py` file. This flexibility allows you to tailor the assistant to meet your specific needs.
